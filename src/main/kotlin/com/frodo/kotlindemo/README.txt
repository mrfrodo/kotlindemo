What is Kotlin
======================



1) JVM Language

    -> Compiles to java byte code and runs on java virtual machine
        -> java byte code:
            Java bytecode is the instruction set for the Java Virtual Machine.
            It acts similar to an assembler which is an alias representation of a C++ code.
            As soon as a java program is compiled, java bytecode is generated.
            In more apt terms, java bytecode is the machine code in the form of a .
        -> java virtual machine:
            JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine.
            It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode
            can be executed.


2) Object oriented

    -> It has classes. It has methods within those classes. Standard OO-stuff.


3) Functional

    -> Kotlin was designed to be a functional language from day 01.
        -> As a functional language Kotlin has support for higher order functions:
            * Can store functions in a collection
            * Pass functions around as parameters
            * Pass a function as parameter to another function
            * Can return functions from functions
        -> Meaning functions, as well as objects, are first class citizens in Kotlin


4) Less ceremony than Java
